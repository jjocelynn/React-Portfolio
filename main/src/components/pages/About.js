          Hi, I'm Jocelyn! I graduated from OCADU with a Bachelors in Fine Arts, specializing in oil painting. Despite my focus on painting, I've
          always maintained a variety of hobbies on the side, one of them being coding. <br /> <br />
          After taking a few art and coding classes, I re-discovered my love of
          coding and decided to take the plunge by enrolling in the Full-Stack
          Developer Bootcamp offered by the University of Toronto. I'm currently
          studying and building my skills as a Full-Stack Developer, with a
          passion for creating dynamic, engaging digital experiences. <br />   <br />
          My background in Fine Arts, coupled with my growing expertise in
          coding, allows me to approach web development with a unique
          perspective and multidisciplinary skill set. I'm excited to continue
          honing my skills and applying my creativity to the world of tech.
